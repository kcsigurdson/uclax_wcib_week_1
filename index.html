    <h3>Katie Sigurdson, ready to learn!</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Katie and I live in Los Angeles, CA. I am originally from Indiana where I attended school at Purdue University. After college, I lived in Texas for two years before moving to the Golden State. The best part about living in Los Angeles, for me, is going to the beach, exploring new hiking trails, and trying new restaurants. I am currently enrolled in the Design Communication Arts certificate program through UCLA Extension and I hope to use what I learn in this program and in this course to become a better developer. The computer I am using for this course is a MacBook Pro.

      I was able to go through the process of setting up my local and hosting environment with fairly few complications. I think it really helped to play the instructional videos on my phone so that I was able to follow along with my entire computer screen. The biggest challenge I had was when it came time to pull my changes to my host site. I was able to clone my repository sucessefully, and make changes that I then pushed to GitHub and could see in the relevant folders in my online repository. In the Terminal, I navigated to the uclax_wcib_week_1 subfolder and executed the "git pull" command with no errors. However the changes that I had made in my .scss file were not being reflected on my host site. It was only after some googling that I found a potential fix, which was to clear my broswer cache. After doing this, I refreshed my site and could see all of my changes. Hopefully this can help anyone else who had this issue!
